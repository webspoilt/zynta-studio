<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <h3>💾 Phase 1: Transactional VFS</h3>
      <p>Atomic file operations with <b>Idempotency verification</b> tracking. Features built-in <b>Transaction Managers</b> with time-traveling, snapshot-based Undo/Redo logic.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">
      <h3>📡 Phase 2: MCP Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>Enterprise-grade observability hooked into the <b>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</b>. Tracks continuous <b>Telemetry</b>, execution latency, and simulated AI hallucination rates.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h3>🤖 Phase 3: SEMAP Orchestration</h3>
      <p><b>Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol</b>. Actor-model architecture mapping agents to specialized roles (Frontend, Backend, DevOps). Includes Debate protocols for consensus.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h3>⚖️ Phase 4: Agent Exchange (AEX)</h3>
      <p>Cutting-edge <b>Combinatorial Auctioning Engine</b>. Distributes workloads to agents based on token capacity, context alignment, and operational cost.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <h3>🎨 Phase 5: Generative Visual UI</h3>
      <p>Powered by Tauri & React. Renders real-time, dynamic execution graphs (<code>VisualLogicTree</code>) mapping the agentic pathways as code is formed.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h3>🛡️ Phase 6 & 7: Red-Teaming & CI/CD</h3>
      <p>Adversarial <b>RedTeamAgents</b> launch continuous jailbreaks countered by <b>BlueTeam</b> live-patching. Fully containerized with <b>Kubernetes Self-Healing</b> deployments.</p>

  <h2>📦 Packaging into a `.exe` (Windows Executable)</h2>
</div>

We use **Tauri** to bundle this incredibly complex application into a single, highly performant native executable. Turn your IDE into a standalone `.exe` you can share or deploy anywhere!

```bash
# 1. Install Dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the production application
npm run tauri build
```
<p align="center">
  <i>✨ That's it! Your shiny new executable will be waiting for you inside: ✨<br><code>src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/</code> and <code>src-tauri/target/release/</code></i>
</p>

  <h2>🤝 Open Source Contribution</h2>
</div>

We believe the future of AI paradigms belongs to the Open Web. That's why this base model operates under the **GPL-3.0 License**.

**You cannot steal this model and hide the code.** However, **you ARE fully encouraged** to make your own custom IDE and fork this base—as long as you keep your derivative work Open Source!

Check the **Issues** tab to start contributing to this awesome framework. We need help:
* Wiring up real LLM endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic).
* Perfecting the Natural Language Debate consensus models.
* Bolstering the Virtual File System persistency.

### 📝 How to Contribute
1. **Fork** the repository ✨
2. Create your Feature Branch: `git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: Add AmazingFeature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`
5. Open a **Pull Request** 🚀
